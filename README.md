Welcome to the official repository for the research paper titled "..............................." This repository houses the code and resources associated with the investigation and comparison of six state-of-the-art deep learning models designed for segmenting the short axis of the abdominal aorta in point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) images.

- **Input:**
This software has been meticulously engineered to seamlessly process 2D point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) images, which are formatted as `.png` or `.jpg` files. These images exhibit dimensions of (x, y, 3), allowing for variations in size, and are fundamental to the core functionality of the software.
For the purpose of testing and demonstration, a curated selection of sample images is at your disposal. These images can be accessed through the following link: [Sample Images](https://github.com/sumit-ai-ml/Aorta-POCUS-Segmentation/tree/main/sample%20images). Additionally, to evaluate the software's effectiveness, you are invited to utilize POCUS images related to the aorta available on Google : [Google POCUS Images for Aorta](https://www.google.com/search?q=pocus+images+aorta&sca_esv=559361602&rlz=1C1YTUH_enDK1050DK1050&tbm=isch&sxsrf=AB5stBgxduktWZ28njA2vmgGVMG-Cec8mw:1692792001968&source=lnms&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwixrtLP3fKAAxWxhf0HHfO_BU8Q_AUoAXoECAEQAw&biw=1706&bih=830&dpr=2.25#imgrc=_D035UwnOBy-4M).
