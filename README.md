- **Input:**
This software is designed to work with 2D point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) images in the formats of `.png` or `.jpg`, with dimensions (x, y, 3). These images can vary in size and will serve as the primary input for the software's functionality. To facilitate testing and demonstration, a collection of sample images is provided, accessible through the following link: [Sample Images](insert_sample_images_link_here).

- **Hosting:**
The web application is hosted using the Hugging Face Spaces platform, providing a convenient and accessible environment for users to interact with the software's features and capabilities.

- **Privacy Assurance:**
We want to assure our users that this software respects your data privacy. We do not gather or retain any image data from interactions with this web software.
